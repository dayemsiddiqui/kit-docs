## Get started in three steps

This quickstart guide assumes that you already have Rust and Cargo up and running on your machine.

<Note>
  [Look at this guide ](https://rust-lang.org/learn/get-started/) if you want to know how to setup Rust and Cargo on your machine.
</Note>

### Step 1: Install the kit-cli

Install the kit-cli on your machine via Cargo using the following command:

```bash Terminal
cargo install kit-cli
```

### Step 2:  Create your project using kit-cli

Run the following command to create your project. Replace the `todo-app` with your project name

```bash Terminal
kit new todo-app
```

The ineractive shell will ask some project specific questions like Project Name, Author etc. Answer all the questions and then the cli will generate the project files for you

### Step 3: Start the web server

Now that you have the project setup you need to go to the project directory and then run kit serve command:

```bash Terminal
cd todo-app
kit serve
```

This will start the web server and in the terminal you will see the URL on which your web server is running. Go to the url and you will find your app up and running!!
