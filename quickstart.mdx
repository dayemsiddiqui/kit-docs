## Get started in three steps

This quickstart guide assumes that you already have Rust and Cargo up and running on your machine.

<Note>
  [Look at this guide ](https://rust-lang.org/learn/get-started/) if you want to know how to setup Rust and Cargo on your machine.
</Note>

### Step 1: Install the kit-cli

Install the kit-cli on your machine via Cargo using the following command:

```bash Terminal
cargo install kit-cli
```

### Step 2:  Create your project using kit-cli

Run the following command to create your project. Replace the `todo-app` with your project name

```bash Terminal
kit new todo-app
```

The ineractive shell will ask some project specific questions like Project Name, Author etc. Answer all the questions and then the cli will generate the project files for you

### Step 3: Run migrations

Before starting the server, run the database migrations to set up the users and sessions tables:

```bash Terminal
cd todo-app
kit migrate
```

### Step 4: Start the web server

Now start the web server using the kit serve command:

```bash Terminal
kit serve
```

This will start the web server and in the terminal you will see the URL on which your web server is running. Go to the url and you will find your app up and running!
